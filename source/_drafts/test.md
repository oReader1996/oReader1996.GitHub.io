everythink is in good order
my house is here
this car looks very good
crocodile meat tastes like chicken
you should keep calm during an earthquake
Mike became a professional basketball player last year
the weather has turned cole and windy

the birds sing happily
this rain will stop in the afternoon
the children are playing in the park
my teacher passed away in hospital yestoday

the teacher put up some pictures on the wall in the classroom
you should respect the old in public places
he began his diet a week ago
he set up a new wolrd record in september 1935
only very few people can realize their dreams

the hot weather made me feel lethargic
